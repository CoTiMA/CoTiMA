\usage{
ctmaSV(
  ctmaInitFit = NULL,
  activeDirectory = NULL,
  primaryStudies = NULL,
  coresToUse = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctmaInitFit}{object to which all single 'ctsem' fits of primary studies has been assigned to (i.e., what has been returned by \code{\link{ctmaInit}})}

\item{activeDirectory}{defines another active directory than the one used in \code{\link{ctmaInit}}}

\item{primaryStudies}{if ctmaInitFit does not contain the primaryStudies object created with  \code{\link{ctmaPrep}} it could be added}

\item{coresToUse}{if negative, the value is subtracted from available cores, else value = cores to use}
}
\value{
returns a modified list of primary studies with starting values added or replaced
}
\description{
derives start values by average discrete time SEM effects, converting them to continuous time, and inversely apply transformations used by 'ctsem'
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
newPrimaryStudyList <- ctmaSV(ctmaInitFit=CoTiMAInitFit_6)
}
