\usage{
ctmaStanResample(ctmaFittedModel = NULL, nsamples = 25, overallSamples = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctmaFittedModel}{a CoTiMA fit object, usually with few 'finishsamples' to prevent memory exhaustion}

\item{nsamples}{sample size per run}

\item{overallSamples}{overall samples size to be achieved}
}
\description{
Re-sample from a fitted stanct model to achieve desired number of finishsamples (could be useful to prevent exhausted memory)
}
